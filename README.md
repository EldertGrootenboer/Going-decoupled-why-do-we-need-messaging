# Going decoupled; why do we need messaging?
Have you ever wondered why you should implement a messaging strategy in your solutions, or when you should introduce this? As a Program Manager for Service Bus, this is a question I get asked frequently by our customers. It is true that implementing a messaging strategy can bring its own challenges. However, if implemented correctly, it will help you solve a myriad of architectural challenges. 

In this session we will dive into the reasons of when and why we should use a messaging strategy, as well as the different types of messaging we can distinguish. You will learn about different patterns which will help solve various architectural challenges, and how we can use a message broker such as Azure Service Bus, Event Hubs, or Event Grid to implement these. 

This session will empower you, by giving a better understanding when to implement messaging in your solutions, and how to can identify patterns where this will help. The concepts from this session are not product specific and can be applied to most messaging services, although we will use the Azure services to explain most of them.
